 How to Use 2-say_my_name.py
===============================

This module is very simple, since it only has one function called
``say_my_name``.

Numbers
=======

``say_my_name()`` prints My name is <first_name> <last_name>

Check for normal conditions: first_name and last_name are strings

::

    >>> say_my_name = __import__('3-say_my_name').say_my_name
    >>> say_my_name("John", "Smith")
    My name is John Smith


>>> say_my_name("Bob")
My name is Bob
