# Higher-level programming - Python, Databases & JavaScript

This repository contains programs written for the higher-level programming
track at Holberton School. In these projects, which began occurring in month
four of the year one curriculum, I learned Python, MySQL and JavaScript.
Simultaneously, I continued to reinforce and expand my skills in C and shell
scripting. The specific list of projects contained follows:

* [ Python - Hello, World](python-hello_world)
* [ Python - if/else, loops, functions](./python-if_else_loops_functions)
